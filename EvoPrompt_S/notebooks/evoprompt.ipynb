    "- **Inicialización (`__init__`):** Configura el dispositivo, carga plantillas, selecciona el modelo de lenguaje y el tokenizer, y configura el logger y la ruta de salida.\n",
    "- **Formación de Demostraciones (`form_demons`):** Prepara muestras de datos fuente y objetivo según la tarea especificada, formatea estas muestras utilizando una plantilla y las concatena en una cadena de demostraciones.\n",
    "- **Creación de Dataset (`create_dataset`):** Prepara las demostraciones y los datos con prompts para la evaluación, maneja los datos específicos del modelo y tokeniza el dataset, creando un DataLoader para el batching.\n",
    "- **Método Forward (`forward`):** Un método abstracto que debe ser sobrescrito en subclases.\n",
    "- **Generación de Hipótesis (`get_generations`):** Crea un dataset para la evaluación y genera hipótesis utilizando diferentes métodos según el modelo de lenguaje."
